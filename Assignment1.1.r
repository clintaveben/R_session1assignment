# 1.	How many ways are there to call a function in R ?

Ans :  Functions are used to logically break our code into simpler parts 
which become easy to maintain and understand. There are 3 methods to call 
a function in R  as follows:
  
  a)	Arguments
  b)	Body
  c)	Environment
The list of argument names are contained within parentheses. 
Next, the body of the function-the statements that are executed 
when it runs-is contained within curly braces ({}). The statements 
in the body are indented by two spaces, which makes the code easier 
to read but does not affect how the code operates.

# 2.	Is the below statement true?

.	The lazy evaluation of a function means, the argument is evaluated 
only if it is evaluated only if it is used inside body of the function.

Ans : True
